# Image-Classification-using-CNN
In this project,a convolution neural network is built in Keras with python on a CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a very popular computer vision dataset.This dataset consists of 60,000 images divided into 10 target classes, with each category containing 6000 images of shape 32x32. This dataset contains images of low resolution (32x32). The 10 different classes of this dataset are:Airplane,Car,Bird,Cat,Deer,Dog,Frog,Horse,Ship and Truck.Firstly,loaded the dataset from keras datasets module and plotted some images from the dataset to visualize the dataset.Then,imported the required layers and modules to create our convolution neural net architecture.Also,Converted the pixel values of the dataset to float type and then normalized the dataset.Performed the one-hot encoding for target classes.Then,created the sequential model and added the layers.Subsequently,configured the optimizer and compiled the model.Also,Viewed the model summary for better understanding of model architecture.Then,trained the model,calculated its accuracy on testing data and saved the model.Finally,created a dictionary to map to the output classes and made predictions from the model.
